## Overview

Is your team working across multiple Github repositories in various organizations? Do you struggle to see which Pull Requests your team has in progress because your inbox is full of notifications for repos that you are watching that are also being worked on by other teams? The goal of this project is to make the team's work in Github more visible through a big visible information radiator.

## Building 

This project uses yarn. Build with `yarn build` and run the tests with `yarn test`. CircleCI will run these 

## Versioning

Semantic release versioning is used, meaning that the commit comments drive the release numbering automatically. More information about the format of commit messages [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).
